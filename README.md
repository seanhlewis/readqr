### This is a custom Chrome extension for the UT BFA Design Class of 25's Senior Exhibition!
Designed and developed by Demi Hu--Portfolio Showcase lead.

This extension is part of an interactive experience encouraging participants to collect QR cards from various student exhibitors, which participants can then scan at portfolio kiosks around the space to display that student's portfolio page. ReadQR takes a live camera feed from a webcam, detects QR codes, and automatically opens the QR link. For security, it only allows access to urls from the utdesigncapstone25.com website.
